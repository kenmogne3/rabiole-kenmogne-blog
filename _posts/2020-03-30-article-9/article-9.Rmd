| General topic?               |  a molecule called nobelitine found in oranges and tangerines could reduce obesity and thus reduce the consequences of obesity such as heart disease and diabetes.     
|
| Procedure/what was examined? | the researchers fed the mice with a diet high in fat and cholesterol and then gave some of the mice nobilitin and some nothing and observed the results.    
 |
| Conclusions/discovery?       |  nobeline would have a positive effect on the reduction of obesity and the resulting metabolic symdromes        |
| Remaining questions?         | how the obese man will react to the nobiletine  ?          |
