|         GIP                         |        one of the incretin hormones produced in the gut in response to eating and known for their ability to influence the body's energy management                                                                                                                                               |

| General topic                             |   study of the interaction between the GIT molecule and leptin: interaction that would promote obesity in the event of overeating in mice        |
| Procedure/what was examined               |     confirmation that GIT binds to brain cells evaluation of the effect of GIP receptor blockade in obese and thin mice                                                                              |
| Conclusions/discovery                     |   a high-fat diet promotes obesity through the action of GIP, which inhibits the action of leptin (a satiety hormone)               |
