| General topic                             |   there is a link between bile and intestinal bacteria and skin immunity because an oily diet leads to psorasia..        |
| Procedure/what was examined               |    mice were subjected to both normal and western diets and observations were made.          
 |

| Conclusions/discovery                     |   the interaction between the skin, intestinal bacteria and bile are mechanisms that will allow us to understand the relationship between a high-fat diet and inflammation of the skin.             |
