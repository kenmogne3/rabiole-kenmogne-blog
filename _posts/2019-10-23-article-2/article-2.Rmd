| Commensal bacteria                        | Gut bacteria                                                                                                                                                      |
| circadian rhythms                         | self-sustaining daily rhythm of activity/sleep alternation, body temperature, heart rate, metabolism and secretion of many hormones                          |
| protein                                   | macromolecules resulting from the assembly of several amino acids having a very important role in the constitution and functioning of the cells of a living organism                                                                                              |

| General topic                             | (commensal microbes that program the circadian rhythms of an organism would promote the absorption of nutrients in general and fats in particular by activating a protein called histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3), which can lead to obesity) |
| Procedure/what was examined               | (study of the interaction of HDAC3 enzymes, histone modifications and gene expression control by comparing normal mice loaded with bacteria with germ-free mice)       |
| Conclusions/discovery                     | (HDAC3 attaches to the molecular clock of cells to ensure that fat absorption is maximized when mammals are awake and eating)                |
| Remaining questions                       | (will this rat study have the same results in humans?)
